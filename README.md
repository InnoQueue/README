## ðŸ“Œ About
- This application can be used to track household chores for roommates.
- A user can create a queue and invite his/her roommates.
- Users complete a queue task one by one in a loop. So, ideally, every roommate should complete a task on each iteration.
- However, a user can skip a task. Then on the next iteration, he/she will be forced to complete this task twice.
- Another possibility is to add your progress of a queue task even if it's not your turn. In this situation, you will be skipped on the next loop iteration.
- If it's someone's turn you can "shake" him to remind him about a task by sending a notification.
- You can track expenses for tasks that require buying something.
- No registration is needed.
